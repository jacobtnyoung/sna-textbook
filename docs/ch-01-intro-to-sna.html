<div id="learning-goals" class="section level2">
<h2>Learning Goals</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Be able to answer these questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What is “network science” and how is it different from “usual”
research?</p></li>
<li><p>What do networks “look like”?</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="motivating-question-and-empirical-example"
class="section level2">
<h2>Motivating Question and Empirical Example</h2>
<p>To get a sense of what we do when we study networks, let’s start with
a motivating question:</p>
<p><em>What determines whether a police officer endorses the use of
body-worn cameras and whether they activate their body-camera during an
incident?</em></p>
<p>Most accounts tend to focus on several factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Individual characteristics (e.g. age, experience)</li>
<li>Situational characteristics (e.g. time of day, incident)</li>
</ul>
<p>In the study of networks, we are interested in just that: <strong>the
network</strong>!</p>
<p>For example, in a study by <a
href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1043986214553380">Young
&amp; Ready (2015)</a> entitled, <em>Diffusion of Ideas and Technology:
The Role of Networks in Influencing the Endorsement and Use of
On-Officer Video Cameras</em>, the authors looked at two research
questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do police officers “frame” body-worn cameras?</li>
<li>Is the meaning officers attribute to cameras created and transmitted
in groups?</li>
</ul>
<p>To answer these questions, they proposed the following model:</p>
<p><img src="images/ch-01-model-figure.jpeg" width="60%" /></p>
<p>In this model, the argued that police officers views of body-worn
cameras influence whether they use their cameras in incidents. Where do
these views come from? The authors proposed a <em>contagion</em> process
whereby officers who shared incidents together exchanged views about the
legitimacy of body-worn cameras.</p>
<p>Thus, the network matters!</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="network-science" class="section level2">
<h2>Network Science</h2>
<p>Network <strong>science</strong> is an approach to science that views
the world as being composed of systems of actors connected through
relational ties (i.e. a <strong>network</strong>).</p>
<ul>
<li><em>What are some ways people can be connected?</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Network science takes these <strong>relational structures</strong> as
the primary domain of interest. In so doing, research questions take the
following forms:</p>
<ul>
<li>How does the network matter?
<ul>
<li>Here the network is an <em>independent variable</em>. In the case
above, the network of shared incidents was as independent variable that
influenced views of body-worn cameras.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What effects the network?
<ul>
<li>Here, the network is a <em>dependent variable</em>. Do younger
individuals who are involved in crime have more co-offenders?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="network-analysis" class="section level2">
<h2>Network Analysis</h2>
<p>Network <strong>analysis</strong> is the set of tools used to study
<em>relational variables</em>. A set of methods for systematically
understanding and identifying connections among actors.</p>
<p><u>Consider three different questions</u>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are kids who are risk-seeking more likely to drink alcohol?</li>
<li>Are kids who have friends that drink alcohol more likely to drink
alcohol?</li>
<li>Are kids who drink alcohol more likely to be popular?</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, think about this: How are these questions different? Is the
causal logic the same? Are the policy implications the same? What are
the variables?</p>
<p>The questions differ substantially in causal logic:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In the first question, the independent variable is risk-seeking
and the dependent variable is alcohol consumption. In the second
question, the independent variable is alcohol consumption among friends.
These two questions have different policy implications. The first would
focus on reducing risk-seeking. The second would focus on disrupting the
network.</p></li>
<li><p>In the third question, the independent variable is alcohol
consumption and the dependent variable is a network variable,
popularity. The policy implication here would be to reduce alcohol
consumption if we were concerned about who (or who is not)
popular.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Here is another <a
href="https://www.theonion.com/sudden-death-of-aunt-creates-rupture-in-family-gossip-p-1819578447">example</a>
from America’s “finest news source”, the Onion:</p>
<p><img src="images/ch-01-gossip.jpeg" width="60%" /></p>
<p>Conceptually, what does this story tell us about the
<strong>relational structure</strong> of information transmission in the
Shelton family?</p>
<p>It is <em>vulnerable</em>!</p>
<p>To understand, we can draw a picture illustrating the network
described in the story:</p>
<p><img src="images/ch-01-gossip-laurie-01.jpeg" width="30%" /></p>
<p>What makes it vulnerable? What happened when aunt Laurie died?</p>
<p><img src="images/ch-01-gossip-laurie-02.jpeg" width="60%" /></p>
<p>Communication is completed disrupted!</p>
<p>Now, consider a separate network arrangement:</p>
<p><img src="images/ch-01-gossip-laurie-03.jpeg" width="30%" /></p>
<p>Now what happens when aunt Laurie dies?</p>
<p><img src="images/ch-01-gossip-laurie-04.jpeg" width="60%" /></p>
<p>Communication is <em>not</em> disrupted. This is because the network
now has <strong>redundant</strong> ties which make it less vulnerable to
disruption.</p>
<p>The point here is this: these topics are inherently
<em>relational</em>.</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="network-science-and-network-analysis" class="section level2">
<h2>Network Science and Network Analysis</h2>
<p>In doing network research (i.e. asking questions that involve
networks and performing network analysis to answer the question), it is
important to consider two crucial ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Conceptualization
<ul>
<li>The process of defining what a concept is by creating a conceptual
definition.</li>
<li>Network science <strong>conceptualizes</strong> theoretical concepts
that are inherently relational.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Operationalization
<ul>
<li>The process of creating a concrete measure following a conceptual
definition of a concept.</li>
<li>Network research <strong>operationalizes</strong> theoretical
constructs by drawing on the formal properties of graphs.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s take an example. Suppose we are interested in the concept of
<em>power</em> in a gang. Some gang members may be more powerful than
others. But, what does it mean to say that someone is powerful? There
are many different ways to conceptualize power. One way is to think
about it as being central members of the gang. So, we could create a
conceptual definition: powerful gang members are those who are central
to the gang network. Ok, so how do we measure it? In other words, how do
we operationalize power based on our conceptual definition? We could say
that individuals who are central in the gang are those who are perceived
as being central. So, we could ask gang members “who is the most central
person in your gang?”. Then, we would have an operationalization of
power in the gang.</p>

<div id="basic-data-elements" class="section level2">
<h2>Basic Data Elements</h2>
<p><em>What do networks “look like”?</em></p>
<div id="network-relational-data-represents" class="section level3">
<h3>Network (relational) data represents:</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Connections</strong> (also called ties, arcs, edges,
lines, ties) among,</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Entities</strong> (also called nodes, vertices, actors,
points, dots)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To be consistent, I will use the term <em>node</em> to refer to
entities and <em>edge</em> to refer to connections.</p>
<p>A <em>node</em> can be anything that can link to something else.
Anything.</p>
<p>An <em>edge</em> can be anything that can record a connection between
nodes. Anything.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In a friendship network the nodes are individuals and the edges
are friendships.</p></li>
<li><p>In a co-offending network the nodes are individuals and the edges
are offense. That is, individuals are connected through an offense in
which they both were present.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>On a graph, nodes are represented by <em>points</em> and edges are
represented by <em>lines</em>.</p>
<p><img src="images/ch-01-net-01.jpeg" width="30%" /></p>
</div>
<div id="edges" class="section level3">
<h3>Edges</h3>
<div id="directionality" class="section level4">
<h4>Directionality</h4>
<p>Edges can be <em>undirected</em>, where an edge from A to B is the
same as an edge from B to A:</p>
<p><img src="images/ch-01-net-02.jpeg" width="30%" /></p>
<p>or <em>directed</em>, where an edge from A to B is separate from an
edge from B to A:</p>
<p><img src="images/ch-01-net-03.jpeg" width="30%" /></p>
<p>The difference is important. For example, suppose the edges of the
networks below measure communication of information.</p>
<p><img src="images/ch-01-net-04.jpeg" width="60%" /></p>
<p><em>How are these structures different?</em></p>
<p>In the undirected network (on the left), all information can reach
all three groups. To see this start at any node and you can reach any
other node following the lines.</p>
<p>But, in the directed network (on the right), information is “stuck”
in the three clusters. Why? This is because information comes from the
center node and goes to each cluster. Even though the all communicate in
each cluster, information does not leave the clusters. To see this,
start with any node and follow the arrows. Once you get into a single
cluster, you cannot leave!</p>
</div>
<div id="value" class="section level4">
<h4>Value</h4>
<p>Edges can take on different values. They can be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Binary (0 or 1; present or absent)</li>
<li>Valued integers (0, 1, 2,…)</li>
<li>Continuous weights (0.24, 1.79,…)</li>
<li>Signed (+ or -)</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, in a friendship network we could be friends or not
(binary), how strong our friendship is (either using integers or
continuous measures), or we could like (signed +) or dislike (signed -)
each other.</p>
</div>
<div id="meanings" class="section level4">
<h4>Meanings</h4>
<p>Edges can have different meanings and therefore be of different
<em>types</em>: * Social relationships (e.g. sister, friend, likes,
knows) * Interactions (has sex with, talks to, seeks advice from) *
Flows (diseases, attitudes, information)</p>
<p>These different types are important to keep in mind when we are
thinking about what a tie represents.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="nodes" class="section level3">
<h3>Nodes</h3>
<div id="modesnode-partitions" class="section level4">
<h4>Modes/Node Partitions</h4>
<p>Networks can differ with respect to the sets of nodes that define
them. This refers to the modes of the network or the partitioning of the
nodes:</p>
<ul>
<li>One-mode/uni-partite (connections among one type of node). For
example, A and B are friends. There is only one group of nodes,
individuals.</li>
<li>Multi-mode/multi-partite (connections among two or more types of
nodes). For example A and B attend protests 1, 2, and 3. There are two
sets of nodes, individuals and protests. A and B are connected through
their shared participation in the protests.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="images/ch-01-net-05.jpeg" width="30%" /></p>
<p>As an example, the network for the study discussed above by <a
href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1043986214553380">Young
&amp; Ready (2015)</a> is shown below:</p>
<p><img src="images/ch-01-net-06.jpeg" width="60%" /></p>
<p>In this network, incidents (white circles) connect officers (squares
and triangles). This is a two-mode/bipartite network because there are
two sets of nodes: incidents and officers. The plot shows two types of
officers, those who were in the treatment condition of the study
(i.e. they were assigned a body-worn camera) and those who were in the
control condition (i.e. they did not receive a camera). The focus of the
study was how exposure to body-cameras during incidents influenced
views, especially for those who were not assigned a camera.</p>
<p>As another example, <a
href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12103-017-9395-5">Schjarback
&amp; Young</a> examined the tendency for United States senators to sign
different types of legislation. Specifically, the authors were
interested in whether crime control legislation was more likely to be
signed if individuals were from the same party.</p>
<p><img src="images/ch-01-net-07.jpeg" width="60%" /></p>
<p>In this network, there are two sets of nodes: bills (crime control
and non-control) and senators (Democrats and Republicans).</p>
</div>
<div id="plexity" class="section level4">
<h4>Plexity</h4>
<p>Networks can also differ with respect to the types of edges.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Simplex (connections among nodes are of one type)</p></li>
<li><p>Multiplex (connections among nodes are of multiple
types)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For example, in the fictitious plot below, individual responded to
three questions: “do you get along with this person?”, “do you discuss
important matters with this person?”, and “is this person
powerful/influential?”</p>
<p><img src="images/ch-01-net-08.jpeg" width="40%" /></p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="summary" class="section level4">
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>To summarize this section, the main take away is that
<em>relational</em> data can take many different forms and be
represented in many different ways.</p>
