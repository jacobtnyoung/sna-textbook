## Preface

<br>

Welcome to the [Social Network Analysis Textbook](https://jacobtnyoung.github.io/sna-textbook/)!  

This textbook is designed to introduce you to basic concepts used in social network analysis (SNA). The textbook is divided into chapters that cover a variety of these concepts. The textbook is not exhaustive, but most of the major topics are discussed.

For those readers who are new to SNA, I would suggest starting at the beginning ([Chapter 1]()) and working through in chronological order. For those readers who are already familiar with SNA, feel free to skip through the chapters.
