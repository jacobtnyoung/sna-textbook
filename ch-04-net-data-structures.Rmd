## Motivating Problem

<br>

Review the figure below, and consider the following problem: Devise a route in which you could cross all seven bridges. 

```{r, fig.cap = "", out.width = "60%"}
knitr::include_graphics( "images/ch-04-bridge-01.jpeg" )
```

<br>

*Now*, consider a different problem: Devise a route in which you could cross all seven bridges, **but** crossing each of the seven bridges <u>only once</u>.

**Did you figure it out?**

<br>

### Konigsberg Bridge Problem

Leonard Euler worked on this problem in the mid 18th century, eventually representing the solution with a set of points and lines. For a great overview fo the problem (and some interesting history), check out this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZwSo4vfw6c).

Recall the discussion from [Chapter 1: Introduction to Social Network Analysis]() about the importance of conceptualizing and operationalizing concepts in network science. *Graph theory* provides a foundation for operationalizing concepts of interest among network scientists.

<br>

## Graph Notation

Definition of a *graph* is $G = (N,L)$, where $N = {n_1, n_2..., n_g}$ defines the set of nodes and $L = {l_1, l_2..., l_L}$ defines the set of edges. This definition simply states that there are $N$ nodes and $L$ edges in a graph.

Two nodes, $n_i$ and $n_j$ are called **adjacent** if the line $l_k = (n_i, n_j)$. What this means is that in the graph, there exists a line between nodes *i* and *j*.

<br>

### Node Sets

Recall the discussion from [Chapter 1: Introduction to Social Network Analysis](https://jacobtnyoung.github.io/sna-textbook/ch-01-intro-to-sna.html) about the directionality of graphs. Edges can be either **undirected** or **directed**. In an **undirected** graph, the order of the nodes does not matter. In other words, $l_k = (n_i, n_j) = (n_j, n_i)$. This is to say that if there exists a line between nodes *i* and *j*, then a line exists between *j* and *i*. (This may seem obvious, but will make more sense why we talk about it this way when we get to **directed** graphs.)

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, fig.width=7, fig.height=5, fig.show="show", fig.align="center"}

par( mar=c( 0.1, 3, 0, 0.1 ), mfrow = c( 1, 2 ) )

set.seed( 19141 )

gplot( u.mat, 
       usearrows=FALSE, 
       vertex.cex=3.2, 
       vertex.col = "lightblue", 
       displaylabels = TRUE, 
       label.pos=5,
       label.cex = 0.8 )
title( "Undirected Graph", line = -5 )

gplot( d.mat, 
       gmode = "digraph",
       vertex.cex=3.2, 
       vertex.col = "orange", 
       displaylabels = TRUE, 
       label.pos=5,
       label.cex = 0.8 )
title( "Directed Graph", line = -5 )

```

### Adjacency

Two nodes, $n_i$ and $n_j$ are **adjacent** if the link $l_k = (n_i,n_j)$. This is to say that in the graph, there exists an edge between nodes *i* and *j*. For a set of relations, $X$, we can define a matrix which represents these relations. We commonly use an **adjacency matrix**, where each node is listed on the row and the column. The $i_{th}$ row and the $j_{th}$ column of $X_{ij}$ records the value of a tie from *i* to *j*. In this approach, $X$, can be thought of as a variable. The presence or absence of values in the cells represent variation..

Here are some important definitions that we will come across as we talk about network data structures:

  * Scalar: a single number
  * Column vector: a column of numbers
  * Row vector: a row of numbers
  * Matrix: a rectangular array of numbers
  * Order: number of rows and columns defining the matrix
  * Square matrix: number of rows and columns of matrix are equal

<br>

#### Undirected, Binary Graphs

The undirected network we showed above is called a *sociogram*:

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, fig.width=5, fig.height=5, fig.show="show", fig.align="center"}

par( mar=c( 1, 0.1, 1, 0.1 ) )

set.seed( 19141 )

gplot( u.mat, 
       usearrows=FALSE, 
       vertex.cex=3, 
       vertex.col = "lightblue", 
       displaylabels = TRUE, 
       label.pos=5, 
       label.cex = 1 )

```

We can represent the graph as a matrix using an adjacency matrix (sometimes called a *sociomatrix*):

```{r, fig.cap = "", out.width = "40%"}
knitr::include_graphics( "images/ch-04-matrix-01.jpeg" )
```

<br>

In most instances, we do not allow self-nominations, so the diagonal of the matrix is usually undefined or set to zero. In networks that allow self-nominations, you can have values on the diagonal. These are referred to as loops.

```{r, fig.cap = "", out.width = "40%"}
knitr::include_graphics( "images/ch-04-matrix-02.jpeg" )
```

<br>

In the first row, *i* sends to the second row only: $X_{12}=1; X_{15}=0$ (where $X_{ij}$ refers to the ith row and the jth column of the matrix). 

```{r, fig.cap = "", out.width = "60%"}
knitr::include_graphics( "images/ch-04-matrix-03.jpeg" )
```

<br>

Since this graph is *undirected*, it is **symmetric** about the diagonal. This means that $X_{ij} = X_{ji}$ or that the *jith* column is the transposition of the *ith* row, as shown in the figure. 

```{r, fig.cap = "", out.width = "60%"}
knitr::include_graphics( "images/ch-04-matrix-04.jpeg" )
```

<br>

Now, what does the rest of the matrix look like? Fill in the values in the matrix based on the graph.

```{r, fig.cap = "", out.width = "60%"}
knitr::include_graphics( "images/ch-04-matrix-05.jpeg" )
```

<br>

Done? It should look like this:

```{r, fig.cap = "", out.width = "60%"}
knitr::include_graphics( "images/ch-04-matrix-06.jpeg" )
```

<br>

Note that I added zeros to the diagonal. As we will see later, we want these values defined for working with the matrix in a software program.

The highlighted section here is called the **lower triangle** of the matrix. The *sum* of the lower triangle should equal the number of edges in the graph.

```{r, fig.cap = "", out.width = "40%"}
knitr::include_graphics( "images/ch-04-matrix-07.jpeg" )
```

<br>

The other highlighted section here is called the **upper triangle** of the matrix. The *sum* of the upper triangle should also equal the number of edges in the graph.

```{r, fig.cap = "", out.width = "40%"}
knitr::include_graphics( "images/ch-04-matrix-08.jpeg" )
```

<br>

Alternatively, we could sum all the elements and divide by 2.

<br>

#### Directed, Binary Graphs

In a **directed** graph, the order of the nodes <u>does</u> matter. Specifically, $l_k1 = (n_i, n_j) \neq (n_j, n_i) = l_k2$.

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, fig.width=5, fig.height=5, fig.show="show", fig.align="center"}

par( mar=c( 1, 0.1, 1, 0.1 ) )

set.seed( 19141 )

gplot( d.mat, 
       gmode = "digraph",
       vertex.cex=3, 
       vertex.col = "orange", 
       displaylabels = TRUE, 
       label.pos=5, 
       label.cex = 1 )

```

What is different in our matrix when the graph is directed?
  
```{r, fig.cap = "", out.width = "40%"}
knitr::include_graphics( "images/ch-04-matrix-01.jpeg" )
```

<br>

In the first row, *i* sends to the second row: $X_{12}=1$.

```{r, fig.cap = "", out.width = "60%"}
knitr::include_graphics( "images/ch-04-matrix-09.jpeg" )
```
    
<br>
        
But, in the second row, *j* does not send $X_{21}=0$. The Jen/Tom dyad is **asymmetric**. Directed graphs permit this asymmetric because $l_k1 = (n_i, n_j) \neq (n_j, n_i) = l_k2$.
      
```{r, fig.cap = "", out.width = "60%"}
knitr::include_graphics( "images/ch-04-matrix-10.jpeg" )
```

<br>
          
What about the Leaf/Bob dyad? Is it *asymmetric* or is it *symmetric*? 

```{r, fig.cap = "", out.width = "60%"}
knitr::include_graphics( "images/ch-04-matrix-11.jpeg" )
```

<br>
              
Now, what does the rest of the matrix look like? Fill in the values in the matrix based on the graph.

```{r, fig.cap = "", out.width = "60%"}
knitr::include_graphics( "images/ch-04-matrix-12.jpeg" )
```

<br>      

Done? It should look like this:

```{r, fig.cap = "", out.width = "60%"}
knitr::include_graphics( "images/ch-04-matrix-13.jpeg" )
```

<br>                

Note that, because we are allowing directionality to matter, the total number of edges in the network is just the sum of the entire matrix.
