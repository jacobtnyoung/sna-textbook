<h2>Learning Goals</h2>

</div>
<div id="concepts-and-operationalization" class="section level2">
<h2>Concepts and Operationalization</h2>
<p>When we say a <em>node</em> is “central”, what do we mean
conceptually? Think of a few examples.</p>
<p>Speaking generally, network position should be interesting and
important:</p>
<ul>
<li>As a <strong>dependent</strong> variable (e.g. are taller
individuals more likely to be trusted?)</li>
<li>As an <strong>independent</strong> variable (e.g. are more popular
adolescents more likely to succeed in school?)</li>
<li>As a description of the <em>position of a node</em></li>
<li>And as a description of an <em>entire network</em></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<div id="conceptualization" class="section level3">
<h3>Conceptualization</h3>
<p>“Everyone agrees, it seems, that centrality is an important
structural attribute of networks. All concede that it is related to a
high degree to other important group properties and processes. But there
consensus ends.” (<a href="">Freeman</a>, 1978/1979: 217)</p>
<p>The type of measure we use depends on the substantive question of
interest. Various measures of centrality are correlated, but they
<em>operationalize</em> different concepts. Put differently, there is
not a single measure of centrality because what we mean by “centrality”
can differ.</p>
<p>Here are three typical ways of thinking about centrality:</p>
<ul>
<li>Degree</li>
<li>Betweenness</li>
<li>Closeness</li>
</ul>
<p>We will discuss each of these concepts, how they are conceptualized
and how they are operationalized in social network analysis.</p>
<p>It is also important to distinguish between whether we are taking
about the centrality of a node or the centrality of a graph:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The centrality of a node (whether it is measured as degree
centraltiy, betweenness centrality, or closeness centrality) refers to
<strong>point</strong> centrality. In other words, the centrality of a
particular point on a graph. What we have been calling a node. When we
talk about point centrality, we are usually comparing different nodes.
For example, is Jim more central than Joan?</p></li>
<li><p>In addition, we can also describe the centrality of an entire
graph, referred to as <strong>graph</strong> centrality. The centrality
measure on an entire graph tells us how centrality measures differ
between nodes in a graph. As we will see, we can describe how
hierarchical or decentralized a graph is based on the
<em>centralization</em> of the graph.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>As with prior chapters, we will start with undirected graphs and then
move to directed graphs.</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="undirected-graphs" class="section level2">
<h2>Undirected Graphs</h2>
<div id="degree-centrality" class="section level3">
<h3>Degree Centrality</h3>
<p>In an undirected binary graph, <em>degree centrality</em> measures
the extent to which a node connects to all other nodes in a network. In
other words, the number of edges incident with a node. This is
symbolized as: <span class="math inline">\(d(n_i)\)</span> and this
reads “degree for the <span class="math inline">\(i_{th}\)</span> node”.
For an undirected binary graph, the degree, <span
class="math inline">\(d(n_i)\)</span>, is simple the row
<strong>or</strong> column sum. We can express this formally as:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(C_D(n_i) = \sum_j x_{ij} = \sum_j
x_{ji}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Which reads: the degree centrality of node <em>i</em> is the sum
over the other nodes in the graph (i.e. <span
class="math inline">\(\sum_j x_{ij} = \sum_j x_{ji}\)</span>). If
<em>i</em> is connected to <em>j</em>, recall that there would be a 1 in
the <span class="math inline">\(X_{ij}\)</span> cell, where <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is the sociomatrix. If <em>i</em> is
not connected to <em>j</em>, then there would be a 0 in the <span
class="math inline">\(X_{ij}\)</span> cell. The equation is just telling
us to some all of the entries.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>Let’s take a look at this with some data. Recall our example network
with Jen, Tom, Bob, Leaf, and Jim:</p>
<p><img src="ch-05-centrality-degree_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png" width="480" /></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Let’s find the degree centrality score for each node. First, let’s
take our graph and create the sociomatrix.</p>
<p><img src="images/ch-05-matrix-01.jpeg" width="60%" /></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Recall from above that in an undirected network the degree centrality
score is either the sum of the row <strong>or</strong> the sum of the
column. Let’s calculate the score for Jen:</p>
<p><img src="images/ch-05-matrix-02.jpeg" width="60%" /></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(C_D(Jen) = \sum_j x_{ij} = x_{Jen, Tom} +
x_{Jen, Bob} + x_{Jen, Leaf} + x_{Jen, Jim} = 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 =
1\)</span></p>
<p>Jen’s degree centrality score is 1, meaning that she has 1 tie.
Notice in the calculation that we didn’t include <span
class="math inline">\(x_{ii}\)</span> which is <span
class="math inline">\(x_{Jen, Jen}\)</span> because this is zero. Be
careful when you do the calculations that you don’t confuse these. Since
self-nominations are usually set to zero, this is not a problem when we
use the row or column totals. Just something to keep in mind.</p>
<p><img src="images/ch-05-matrix-01.jpeg" width="60%" /></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><em>What about the other nodes?</em></p>
<p>Let’s do the calculations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tom = <span class="math inline">\(C_D(Tom) = \sum_j x_{ij} = x_{Tom,
Jen} + x_{Tom, Bob} + x_{Tom, Leaf} + x_{Tom, Jim} = 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 =
2\)</span></li>
<li>Bob = <span class="math inline">\(C_D(Bob) = \sum_j x_{ij} = x_{Bob,
Jen} + x_{Bob, Tom} + x_{Bob, Leaf} + x_{Bob, Jim} = 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 =
3\)</span></li>
<li>Leaf = <span class="math inline">\(C_D(Leaf) = \sum_j x_{ij} =
x_{Leaf, Jen} + x_{Leaf, Tom} + x_{Leaf, Bob} + x_{Leaf, Jim} = 0 + 0 +
1 + 1 = 2\)</span></li>
<li>Jim = <span class="math inline">\(C_D(Jim) = \sum_j x_{ij} = x_{Jim,
Jen} + x_{Jim, Tom} + x_{Jim, Bob} + x_{Jim, Jim} = 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 =
2\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="standardization" class="section level3">
<h3>Standardization</h3>
<p>Actor degree centrality not only reflects each node’s connectivity to
other nodes but also depends on the size of the network, <em>g</em>.
Larger networks will have a higher maximum possible degree centrality
value. This is called a <em>raw</em> score. How can we nodes from
different sized networks? <em>Solution?</em></p>
<p>Standardize! If we want to compare nodes in different sized networks,
then we just take into account the number of nodes and the maximum
possible nodes to which <em>i</em> could be connected. In an undirected
graph, this is <em>g-1</em>.</p>
<p>Thus, we can calculate a standardized degree centrality for an
undirected graph as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[C&#39;_D(n_i) =  \dfrac{C_D(n_i)}{g-1} =
\dfrac{\sum\limits_{j} x_{ij}}{g-1}\]</span></p>
<p>What this gives us is the proportion of the network members with ties
to actor <em>i</em>. A convenient feature of standardizing in this way
is that it means the index varies between 0 (no connections; isolate) to
1 (ties to every actor).</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at our example network:</p>
<p><img src="images/ch-05-matrix-01.jpeg" width="60%" /></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>For this graph, the denominator, <em>g-1</em> is <span
class="math inline">\(5 - 1 = 4\)</span>. Plugging that in we get: <span
class="math inline">\(C&#39;_D(n_i) = \dfrac{C_D(n_i)}{4}\)</span>.</p>
<p>And recall our raw scores:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jen = 1</li>
<li>Tom = 2</li>
<li>Bob = 3</li>
<li>Leaf = 2</li>
<li>Jim = 2</li>
</ul>
<p>So, we just adjust the <em>raw</em> scores by standardizing by the
denominator:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jen = $C’_D(Jen) = = 0.25 $</li>
<li>Tom = $C’_D(Tom) = = 0.50 $</li>
<li>Bob = $C’_D(Bob) = = 0.75 $</li>
<li>Leaf = $C’_D(Leaf) = = 0.50 $</li>
<li>Jim = $C’_D(Jim) = = 0.50 $</li>
</ul>
<p>How is this to be interpreted? The standardized degree centrality
score gives us is the proportion of the network members with ties to
actor <em>i</em>. So, a score of 0.25 for Jen means that Jen has ties to
25% of the nodes that she could potentially have ties to in the network.
In other words, of the four people she could have ties with, she only
has ties with one node.</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="mean-degree" class="section level3">
<h3>Mean Degree</h3>
<p>We can examine the summary statistics for degree centrality by
inspecting the <strong>mean</strong>. The average degree is an important
property of a network. <em>Why? What does a network with a high average
degree look like? A low average degree?</em></p>
<p>The mean degree for an undirected network is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\bar C_D =  \dfrac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^g
C_D(n_i)}{g} = \dfrac{2L}{g}\]</span></p>
<p>This may look a bit overwhelming, but we can break it into
pieces:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\dfrac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^g
C_D(n_i)}{g}\)</span> just says to sum up the degrees for each node and
then divide by the number of nodes, <em>g</em>.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\dfrac{2L}{g}\)</span> shows that the
equation above reduces to a simple calculation, the number of edges in
the graph, <em>L</em>, multiplied by 2 and then divided by the number of
nodes, <em>g</em>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>What is the mean degree for this graph?</p>
<p><img src="ch-05-centrality-degree_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="480" /></p>
<p>Well, we have <span class="math inline">\(L=5\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(g = 5\)</span>, so plugging the numbers we
get:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\bar C_D =  \dfrac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^g
C_D(n_i)}{g} = \dfrac{2L}{g} = \dfrac{2*5}{5} = \dfrac{10}{5} =
2\]</span> The average degree for this graph is 2. In other words, on
average, a node has two edges.</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="degree-centralization" class="section level3">
<h3>Degree Centralization</h3>
<p>In addition to summarizing the graph with the <em>mean degree</em>,
we can also calculate the centralization of the graph. Centralization
measures the extent to which the nodes in a social network differ from
one another in their individual centrality scores. Put differently, how
much variation is there in the distribution of centrality scores?</p>
<p>We can calculate this as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[C_A =  \dfrac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^g
[C_A(n^*) - C_A(n_i)]}{max \sum\limits_{i=1}^g [C_A(n^*) -
C_A(n_i)]}\]</span></p>
<p>Again, this may look imposing, but we can decompose it to see what it
is doing:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(C_A(n^*)\)</span> is the largest degree
centrality scored observed in the graph</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(C_A(n_i)]\)</span> is the degree
centrality score for node <em>i</em></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\sum\limits_{i=1}^g [C_A(n^*) -
C_A(n_i)]\)</span> simply takes the sum of deviations for each node from
the largest value</li>
<li>Finally, we take that sum and divide it by <span
class="math inline">\(max \sum\limits_{i=1}^g [C_A(n^*) -
C_A(n_i)]\)</span>, which is the theoretical maximum sum possible of
differences</li>
</ul>
<p>This should look familiar, recall from your introductory statistics
course that the standard deviation of a variable, <em>y</em> is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[SD_y = \sqrt{\frac{\sum{(y_i -
\mu)}^2}{N}}\]</span></p>
<p>That is, the sum of squared deviations of <span
class="math inline">\(y_i\)</span> from the population mean, <span
class="math inline">\(mu\)</span>, divided by <em>N</em>, the size of
the population. We are doing something similar with the centralization
score. It is the sum of observed differences divided by the theoretical
maximum sum possible of differences.</p>
<p>For degree centrality, the maximum possible sum of differences is
calculated as <span class="math inline">\((g-1)(g-2)\)</span>. Which
makes the equation:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(C_D = \dfrac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^g
[C_D(n^*) - C_D(n_i)]}{[(g-1)(g-2)]}\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>If I lost you in some of the math, don’t worry. Let’s calculate the
degree centralization score for our example graph:</p>
<p><img src="images/ch-05-matrix-01.jpeg" width="60%" /></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>And recall our raw scores:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jen = 1</li>
<li>Tom = 2</li>
<li>Bob = 3</li>
<li>Leaf = 2</li>
<li>Jim = 2</li>
</ul>
<p>Bob has the largest degree at 3. This means that <span
class="math inline">\(C_D(n^*) = 5\)</span>. Finally, recall that <span
class="math inline">\(g = 5\)</span> since we have 5 nodes.</p>
<p>Now, all we have to do is plug in the values:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[C_D =  \dfrac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^g
[C_D(n^*) - C_D(n_i)]}{[(g-1)(g-2)]} =
\dfrac{(3-1)+(3-2)+(3-3)+(3-2)+(3-2)}{(5-1)(5-2)} =
\dfrac{2+1+0+1+1}{4*3}= \dfrac{5}{12}= 0.4167\]</span></p>
<p>So, the degree centralization score for our example graph is 0.4167.
<em>What does this mean?</em></p>
<p>When degree centrality is evenly dispersed, meaning that all nodes
have the same degree, then the numerator in the equation will be zero
and the quotient will be close to 0. When there is considerable
inequality in the degree centrality scores between nodes, the quotient
will be closer to 1. Thus, closer to 1 indicates that the graph is
hierarchically structured and closer to 0 means that the graph is more
decentralized.</p>
<p>We can see this by examining two additional undirected networks.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><img src="ch-05-centrality-degree_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="480" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>The degree centralization score for the figure on the left is 1.0. We
can see this by doing the calculations:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[C_D =  \dfrac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^g
[C_D(n^*) - C_D(n_i)]}{[(g-1)(g-2)]} =

<p>The degree centralization score for the figure on the right is 0. We

<h3>Degree Centrality</h3>
<p>In a directed binary graph, degree centrality can be broken down into
<em>indegree</em> and <em>outdegree</em> centrality:</p>
<ul>
<li>Indegree, <span class="math inline">\(CI(n_i)\)</span>, measures the
number of ties that <em>i</em> receives. For the sociomatrix <span
class="math inline">\(X_{ij}\)</span>, the indegree for <em>i</em> is
the <strong>column</strong> sum:</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math display">\[C_I(n_i) = \sum_j x_{ji}\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Outdegree, <span class="math inline">\(CO(n_i)\)</span>, measures
the number of ties that <em>i</em> sends. For the sociomatrix <span
class="math inline">\(X_{ij}\)</span>, the outdegree for <em>i</em> is
the <strong>row</strong> sum:</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math display">\[C_O(n_i) = \sum_j x_{ij}\]</span></p>
<p>What are the <em>indegree</em> and <em>outdegree</em> centrality
scores in the following graph?:</p>
<p><img src="images/ch-05-matrix-03.jpeg" width="60%" /></p>
<p><br></p>
<div id="indegree" class="section level4">
<h4>Indegree</h4>
<p>Let’s start with the indegree. As stated above, indegree, <span
class="math inline">\(CI(n_i)\)</span>, measures the number of ties that
<em>i</em> receives. For the sociomatrix <span
class="math inline">\(X_{ij}\)</span>, the indegree for <em>i</em> is
the <strong>column</strong> sum: <span class="math inline">\(C_I(n_i) =
\sum_j x_{ji}\)</span>.</p>
<p>So, to get the indegree for each node, we just sum over the columns.
Recall that columns are vertical.</p>
<p><img src="images/ch-05-matrix-04.jpeg" width="60%" /></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Let’s calculate the indegree for Jen: <span
class="math inline">\(C_I(Jen) = \sum_j x_{j,Jen} = x_{Tom,Jen} +
x_{Bob,Jen} + x_{Leaf,Jen} + x_{Jim,Jen} = 0+0+0+0 = 0\)</span></p>
<p>Jen’s indegree is 0 because she doesn’t receive <em>any</em> ties
from other nodes. Let’s calculate the indegree for the rest of the
nodes:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(C_I(Tom) = \sum_j x_{j,Tom} =
x_{Jen,Tom} + x_{Bob,Tom} + x_{Leaf,Tom} + x_{Jim,Tom} = 1+0+0+0 =
1\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(C_I(Bob) = \sum_j x_{j,Bob} =
x_{Jen,Bob} + x_{Tom,Bob} + x_{Leaf,Bob} + x_{Jim,Bob} = 0+1+1+1 =
3\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(C_I(Leaf) = \sum_j x_{j,Leaf} =
x_{Jen,Leaf} + x_{Tom,Leaf} + x_{Bob,Leaf} + x_{Jim,Leaf} = 0+0+1+1 =
2\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(C_I(Jim) = \sum_j x_{j,Jim} =
x_{Jen,Jim} + x_{Tom,Jim} + x_{Bob,Jim} + x_{Leaf,Jim} = 0+0+1+1 =
2\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="outdegree" class="section level4">
<h4>Outdegree</h4>
<p>Let’s now look at the outdegree. With indegree, we are looking at the
ties coming into a node. But, with outdegree we are doing the opposite,
looking at the ties that are coming from the node. As stated above,
Outdegree, <span class="math inline">\(CO(n_i)\)</span>, measures the
number of ties that <em>i</em> sends. For the sociomatrix <span
class="math inline">\(X_{ij}\)</span>, the outdegree for <em>i</em> is
the <strong>row</strong> sum <span class="math inline">\(C_O(n_i) =
\sum_j x_{ij}\)</span>.</p>
<p>So, to get the outdegree for each node, we just sum over the rows.
Recall that rows are horizontal.</p>
<p><img src="images/ch-05-matrix-05.jpeg" width="60%" /></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Let’s calculate the outdegree for Jen: <span
class="math inline">\(C_O(Jen) = \sum_j x_{Jen,j} = x_{Jen,Tom} +
x_{Jen,Bob} + x_{Jen,Leaf} + x_{Jen,Jim} = 1+0+0+0 = 1\)</span></p>
<p>Let’s calculate the outdegree for the rest of the nodes:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(C_O(Tom) = \sum_j x_{Tom,j} =
x_{Tom,Jen} + x_{Tom,Bob} + x_{Tom,Leaf} + x_{Tom,Jim} = 0+1+0+0 =
1\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(C_O(Bob) = \sum_j x_{Bob,j} =
x_{Bob,Jen} + x_{Bob,Tom} + x_{Bob,Leaf} + x_{Bob,Jim} = 0+0+1+1 =
2\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(C_O(Leaf) = \sum_j x_{Leaf,j} =
x_{Leaf,Jen} + x_{Leaf,Tom} + x_{Leaf,Bob} + x_{Leaf,Jim} = 0+0+1+1 =
2\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(C_O(Jim) = \sum_j x_{Jim,j} =
x_{Jim,Jen} + x_{Jim,Tom} + x_{Jim,Bob} + x_{Jim,leaf} = 0+0+1+1 =
2\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>Now, let’s compare the indegree and outdegree:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Node</th>
<th>Indegree</th>
<th>Outdegree</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Jen</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>1</td>

<tr class="even">

<tr class="odd">

<tr class="even">

<tr class="odd">

<tr class="even">

<td>——–</td>
<td>———</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">

<td>8</td>
<td>8</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Note that both the indegree and outdegree total to the same amount.
This makes sense because there are <span
class="math inline">\(L=8\)</span> edges in the graph.</p>

</div>
<div id="standardization-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Standardization</h3>
<p>Recall that indegree/outdegree centrality not only reflects each
node’s connectivity to other nodes but also depends on the size of the
graph, <em>g</em>. Larger networks will have a higher maximum possible
degree centrality value. We can standardize, or normalize, the same way
by dividing by <em>g-1</em>.</p>
<p>Recall that for our example graph, <span class="math inline">\(g-1 =
4\)</span> and that our raw scores:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Indegree</p>
<ul>
<li>Jen = 0</li>
<li>Tom = 1</li>
<li>Bob = 3</li>
<li>Leaf = 2</li>
<li>Jim = 2</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Outdegree</p>
<ul>
<li>Jen = 1</li>
<li>Tom = 1</li>
<li>Bob = 2</li>
<li>Leaf = 2</li>
<li>Jim = 2</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>We just adjust the <em>raw</em> <strong>indegree</strong> scores by
standardizing by the denominator:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jen = $C’_I(Jen) = = 0.00 $</li>
<li>Tom = $C’_I(Tom) = = 0.25 $</li>
<li>Bob = $C’_I(Bob) = = 0.75 $</li>
<li>Leaf = $C’_I(Leaf) = = 0.50 $</li>
<li>Jim = $C’_I(Jim) = = 0.50 $</li>
</ul>
<p>How is this to be interpreted? The standardized indegree centrality
score gives us is the proportion of the network members for whom node
<em>i</em> has received a tie. A score of 0.25 for Tom means that Tom
received ties from 25% of the nodes that he could potentially have
received ties from in the network.</p>
<p>For the <em>raw</em> <strong>outdegreee</strong> scores we do the
same:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jen = $C’_O(Jen) = = 0.25 $</li>
<li>Tom = $C’_O(Tom) = = 0.25 $</li>
<li>Bob = $C’_O(Bob) = = 0.50 $</li>
<li>Leaf = $C’_O(Leaf) = = 0.50 $</li>
<li>Jim = $C’_O(Jim) = = 0.50 $</li>
</ul>
<p>How is this to be interpreted? The standardized outdegree centrality
score gives us is the proportion of the network members for whom node
<em>i</em> has sent a tie. A score of 0.25 for Tom means that Tom sends
ties to 25% of the nodes that he could potentially have sent ties to in
the network.</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="mean-degree-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Mean Degree</h3>
<p>As before, we can examine the summary statistics for
indegree/outdegree centrality by inspecting the
<strong>mean</strong>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\bar d =  \dfrac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^g
C_I(n_i)}{g} = \dfrac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^g C_O(n_i)}{g} =
\dfrac{L}{g}\]</span> We just take the number of edges in the graph,
<span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>, and divide it by the number of
nodes in the graph, <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span>.</p>
<p>As it turns out, the mean indegree and mean outdegree are equal. This
is because we are counting up, for the numerator, the number of
edges.</p>
<p>What is the mean indegree/outdegree for this graph?</p>
<p><img src="ch-05-centrality-degree_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png" width="480" /></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\bar d =  \dfrac{C_I(n_i)}{g} =
\dfrac{C_O(n_i)}{g} = \dfrac{L}{g} = \dfrac{8}{5} = 1.6\]</span></p>
<p>This means that, on average, a node sends 1.6 ties and receives 1.6
ties.</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="degree-centralization-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Degree Centralization</h3>
<p>As with the undirected graph, we can also calculate how centralized
the edges are in the graph. Recall that degree centralization measures
the extent to which the nodes in a graph differ from one another in
their individual degree centrality scores. For a directed graph, the
difference is that the denominator is <span
class="math inline">\((g-1)^2\)</span> or <span
class="math inline">\((g-1)(g-1)\)</span>. The difference is due to the
directional nature of the graph. So, this gives us the following
equation for either the indegree centralization score or the outdegree
centralization score:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[C_D =  \dfrac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^g
[C_D(n^*) - C_D(n_i)]}{[(g-1)^2]}\]</span></p>
<div id="indegree-centralization" class="section level4">
<h4>Indegree Centralization</h4>
<p>Let’s calculate the indegree centralization score for our example
graph:</p>
<p><img src="images/ch-05-matrix-03.jpeg" width="60%" /></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>And recall our raw indegree scores:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jen = 0</li>
<li>Tom = 1</li>
<li>Bob = 3</li>
<li>Leaf = 2</li>
<li>Jim = 2</li>
</ul>
<p>Bob has the largest degree at 3. This means that <span
class="math inline">\(C_D(n^*) = 5\)</span>. Finally, recall that <span
class="math inline">\(g = 5\)</span> since we have 5 nodes.</p>
<p>Now, all we have to do is plug in the values:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[C_I =  \dfrac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^g
[C_I(n^*) - C_I(n_i)]}{[(g-1)(g-1)]} =
\dfrac{(3-0)+(3-1)+(3-3)+(3-2)+(3-2)}{(5-1)(5-1)} =
\dfrac{3+2+0+1+1}{4*4}= \dfrac{7}{16}= 0.4375\]</span></p>
<p>The indegree centralization score for our example graph is 0.4375.
<em>What does this mean?</em></p>
<p>Recall that when degree centrality is evenly dispersed, meaning that
all nodes have the same degree, then the numerator in the equation will
be zero and the quotient will be close to 0. When there is considerable
inequality in the degree centrality scores between nodes, the quotient
will be closer to 1. Thus, closer to 1 indicates that the graph is
hierarchically structured and closer to 0 means that the graph is more
decentralized.</p>
<p>When we introduce directionality, we have to alter our language a
bit. When indegree centrality is evenly dispersed, meaning that all
nodes receive the same number of ties, then the numerator in the
equation will be zero and the quotient will be close to 0. Thus, closer
to 1 indicates that the indegrees in the graph are hierarchically
structured and closer to 0 means that the indegrees for the graph are
more decentralized.</p>

<div id="outdegree-centralization" class="section level4">
<h4>Outdegree Centralization</h4>
<p>Now, let’s calculate the outdegree centralization score for our
example graph:</p>
<p><img src="images/ch-05-matrix-03.jpeg" width="60%" /></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>And recall our raw outdegree scores:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jen = 1</li>
<li>Tom = 1</li>
<li>Bob = 2</li>
<li>Leaf = 2</li>
<li>Jim = 2</li>
</ul>
<p>Bob, Leaf, and Jim all have the largest degree at 2. This means that
<span class="math inline">\(C_D(n^*) = 2\)</span>. Finally, recall that
<span class="math inline">\(g = 5\)</span> since we have 5 nodes.</p>
<p>Now, all we have to do is plug in the values:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[C_O =  \dfrac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^g
[C_O(n^*) - C_O(n_i)]}{[(g-1)(g-1)]} =
\dfrac{(2-1)+(2-1)+(2-2)+(2-2)+(2-2)}{(5-1)(5-1)} =
\dfrac{1+1+0+0+0}{4*4}= \dfrac{2}{16}= 0.125\]</span></p>
<p>The outdegree centralization score for our example graph is 0.125.
<em>What does this mean?</em></p>
<p>An outdegree centralization score close to 1 indicates that the
outdegrees in the graph are hierarchically structured and closer to 0
means that the outdegrees for the graph are more decentralized.</p>
